 # Course Description

 > This course will teach students to think critically about data and their assemblages. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical and political implications of data via a number of contemporary issues.

 > In the literature we discover that we are data subjects, datafied, we have a data double, we leave behind data shadows, statistical agencies try to create a data person, data socially shape us, some suggest we are domesticated by data, others point to a dataism ideology and while others argue that we are in the midst of a data revolution.

> In this course we will examine what data are, the power of data, how they are used, who owns them, and if and when linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps and infographics, assess if these determine actions and material outcomes.  Students will learn to conceptualize data technically, philosophically, ethically, in the political economy, institutionally and in time and space. In short, students will learn how to think critically about data.

 # Course Objectives

 * distinguish big data from small data, and recognize different types of data;
 * conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;
 * identify data politics and critically read data policies; and
 * think about data-based knowledge, the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

 ### Final Essay
In this essay you will pick a dataset or database of your choice.  You will describe those data using the descriptive vocabulary and the methods adopted for assignment 1 and the readings. You will then frame those data as per Kitchin’s socio-technical data assemblage and conceptualizations and also consider the 7 points for a critical data studies by Dalton and Thatcher. You will also seek legislation, regulation, policy, a report, a documentary or a piece of investigative journalism related to the dataset, and issues related to the data. You may choose any class resources and any others. You must engage with concepts referred to in the readings. You will have a research question, for example:
* _How do the datasets related to mass shootings discursively advance or impede gun control policy?_ 
* _How does the NRA dispute mass shooting data and employ their own form of ‘right to bear arms’ data based counter narrative?_  
* _Do the police shooting databases provide a comprehensive account of this phenomenon in the US?_ Etc.  
In this case you may find infographics to influence the stories, lobbying reports by police unions, the NRA, state legislature etc. related to this issue.  You are not doing a statistical analysis, you are assessing policy/issue/problem which led to the creation of the dataset you, its data assemblage, what makes it authoritative, questionable, and if it has had any effect.

#### Essay Proposal (due Week 5: Feb. 9) (5 %): 
It will be marked with comments and by Week 6 after study break. This should include a tentative title, the topics you wish to examine, why this important or significant and is of interest to you, (2-3 pages MAX can be in point form). Include the source of the data you would like to study, point out how it relates to what you wish to discuss, include a list of related topics/issues/concepts you might use to inform your argument, a tentative research questions, and a preliminary bibliography.
#### Annotated bibliography (due Week 8 Mar. 8) (10%):
Based on proposal comments and your revisions you will have selected papers, reports, books, datasets, etc. of relevance to your argument. 
For this assignment you are asked to produce an annotated bibliography (8-10 sources minimum) where you will summarize the key arguments, discuss how it relates to the course, and specify how it informs your essay.
This is a [useful guide](http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/specific-types-of-writing/annotated-bibliography).

#### Final Essay (due April 12) (15%):
It is a 15-20 pages of text (MAX) essay, including references and the cover page. In addition you may insert images, charts, and tables, etc. It is to be submitted to CuLearn and include the following on the title page:

### Assignment 1 (Due midnight Jan. 18) (10 %):

 > Look for a CANADIAN dataset related to the in-class exercise and download those data. In 1-3 pages (MAX), explain the download process (the steps you took), the dissemination platform (e.g. a portal, news blog, data library, wiki, etc.), and describe the dataset, its intended use, the institution that produced it, how it was created, geographic extent, time extent, etc. Refer to the Kinds of Data Section of Chapter 1 of the Data Revolution to help you describe the data and the class slides. Be sure to provide a full citation of the dataset with a URL, and footnote licences, terms of use, and any methodological guides, reports, metadata, etc. Finally, in a few paragraphs, assess if there is potential bias, methodological strengths and limitations, consider what is not being measured, discuss if you trust these data and if so why or why not.

## Week 2 (Jan.19)- Conceptualizing data

This week, students will develop critical abilities to read data. We will examine Kitchin’s 5 ways to frame data and the socio-technical data assemblage. We will also discuss the 7 points for a critical data studies by Dalton and Thatcher. In doing so we will refer to the datasets we examined last week and the datasets you discovered for your assignment.

#### Readings:
* Kitchin, Rob. Chapter 1, [_The Data Revolution._](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3683612) (26 pages)
* Dalton, Craig and Thatcher, Jim. [_What does a critical data studies look like, and why do we care? Seven points for a critical approach to ‘big data.’_](http://societyandspace.com/material/commentaries/craig-dalton-and-jim-thatcher-what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care-seven-points-for-a-critical-approach-to-big-data/)(6 pages)

#### _Assignment 1 is due_

### Assignment 2 (5 %) due IN CLASS Feb. 23:
> We will split the class in 2. We will each make a formal request for our personal free credit score. 50% of the class will order it from TransUnion Canada and the other half from Equifax Canada.

> To do so, you will need to print and out a form, sign it,copy 2 sides of the required ID from a list on their respective websites, and mail it in. There is a post office in the Unicentre Store on the ground floor.  I will provide envelopes and forms in class. We will use these data later in the class and construct a database of our collective score.

> **Credit score data are private to you, I would ask that you report the results of your score without your name on a sheet of paper, print it and bring that sheet to Week 6 class after the break**. Be sure to include whether it is from TransUnion or Equifax. I will send details out to you on how to format. We will use these to create a database of our collective credit scores in class.

 #### _Follow-up on Credit Score Assignment 2_
 
 
## Week 5 (Feb. 9) – The Characteristics of Big Data

During week 2, we briefly discussed small data, this week students will learn about what big data are and to define and distinguish big data from small data. In addition students will study the nature of big data, the characteristics of survey data, administrative data and big data and unpack the ontological traits of a number of datasets.  In class we will critically compare how 2 skill gaps reports are framing national policy, and a related industry association report.

#### Readings:

#### _Follow-up on Credit Score Assignment 2_

## Week 6 (Feb. 23) – The Enablers of Big Data
*Welcome back!*

This week students will learn to think historically by examining the enablers of big data. We will do a high level genealogy of the technologies associated with the emergence of big data  especially networks, systems, devices and sensors, social media and a variety of methods to collect data. By doing students will learn that technological ‘revolutions’ do not come from no-where, they are evolutionary, and they have a past which in this case is part of a large socio-technological data assemblage. Concurrently we will examine how the state of Massachusetts is strategically positioning itself as the big data centre of power in the US, by studying 2 key reports one spearheaded by the Governor’s Office and the other by an industry association.

#### Reading:
* Chapter 5. [_The Data Revolution._](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3683612)(20 pages).
#### In class we will discuss the following 2 reports:
* The MASSTech [Big Data Report](http://masstech.org/research-and-analysis/mass-big-data-report)
* The MASS TLC [Big Data Report](http://www.masstlc.org/?page=2013BigDataReport)

#### _Week 2 Assignment is due – 1 page anonymous credit score_ 

#### Assignment 4: (due Feb. 29) (10%)

> In the MacOdrum Library Map, Data and Government Information Centre (MADGIC) on the ground floor there is a map display for COMM4419.  There you will find a series of historical maps on the Evolution of the Communication Infrastructure in Canada.  The maps are organized into 6 groups, and in each group there is accompanying documentation. You are to construct a table as follows and fill in the necessary information.  See the legend, the title and read the map on both sides to get this information.  In the observation column, describe any spatial patterns and any relationships you think exist between the maps within each group, and in the last row share your observations about spatial patterns across time, and/or the topics, and/or the relationship between technologies, and/or the changes in technologies across time. Some of these maps and books are very old and rare so please treat them with care.  Finally, discuss in a few sentences how these maps relate to the enablers of big data.  For general interest, you may find some of the documentation associated with the maps interesting and the [_Atlas of Cyberspace_](http://www.kitchin.org/atlas/) is made available to help you read the maps.

## Week 7 (Mar. 1) – Data Science & Data Analytics

You have been building your data knowledge, you have learned how to distinguish big and small data, last week we studied the enablers of big data and this week we investigate the techniques.  We will discuss these techniques in relation to our credit scores and some of of the topics we discussed about data brokerage in Week 4. You will also learn about algorithms, social sorting and predictive policing.

In 2-3 pages (MAX), discuss how your credit score was created, the factors that led to your final scores, what was used to develop that score, what indices are referred to, how long does it take to clear it, and how do you go about improving it. Also, discuss how the credit scoring company got your data and who else to see them? Finally, discuss the social shaping qualities of these data more broadly, and be sure to refer to related concepts examined to date in class and in the readings.

## Week 8 (Mar. 8) – The Rationale for Big Data

## Week 9 (Mar. 15) – The End of Science?

Many enthusiasts suggest that science as we know it is obsolete, as we can now rely on big data and data driven science.  Does this mark a new positivist era, where the sexiest job is that of a data scientists, an era based on prediction, super forecasting and fortune telling based on algorithms and terabytes of unstructured data?  This week we will examine how some areas of science are changing and why data driven science answers some questions and not others.
